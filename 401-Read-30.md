## Graph Data Structure
 Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges, is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges, connecting the pairs of vertices. 

## Graph Data Structer Copmonent:
* Vertex: Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex.
* Edge: Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. 
* Adjacency: Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.
* Path: Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. 

## Types of graphs:
* Undirected Graph: In an undirected graph, nodes are connected by edges that are all bidirectional.
* Directed Graph: In a directed graph, nodes are connected by directed edges â€“ they only go in one direction.

there is cyclic and uncyclic Graph the diffrence between them is the if the nodes are connected togather or not .

Adjacency matrices are helpful when we need to quickly check if two nodes have a direct edge or not. However, the main disadvantage is its large memory complexity. 

Edges lists are the least used data structure
