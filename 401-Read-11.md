## What is a Stack
A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

### Common terminology for a stack is

* Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* Top - This is the top of the stack.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

### Stacks follow these concepts:

#### FILO
First In Last Out :This means that the first item added in the stack will be the last item popped out of the stack.

#### LIFO
Last In First Out :This means that the last item added to the stack will be the first item popped out of the stack.

## What is a Queue
Common terminology for a queue is

* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
* Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
* Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
* IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.

### Queues follow these concepts:

#### FIFO
First In First Out :This means that the first item in the queue will be the first item out of the queue.

#### LILO
Last In Last Out :This means that the last item in the queue will be the last item out of the queue.

### Enqueue O(1)
When you add an item to a queue, you use the enqueue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it does not matter how many other items live in the queue (n); it takes the same amount of time to perform the operation.

### Dequeue O(1)
When you remove an item from a queue, you use the dequeue action. This is done with an O(1) operation in time because it doesnâ€™t matter how many other items are in the queue, you are always just removing the front Node of the queue

### Peek O(1)
When conducting a peek, you will only be inspecting the front Node of the queue.
