## Event-Driven Programming in Node.js

Event-Driven Programming is a logical pattern that we can choose to confine our programming within to avoid issues of complexity and collision. In this article we’re going to go over how Event-Driven Programming works and how we can make the best use of it in our Node.js projects.

## Event-Driven Programming makes use of the following concepts:

* An Event Handler is a callback function that will be called when an event is triggered.
* A Main Loop listens for event triggers and calls the associated event handler for that event.

## EventEmitter
Node.js natively provides us with a useful module called EventEmitter that allows us to get started incorporating Event-Driven Programming in our project right away.

## Removing Listeners
There will likely come a time when you want to remove an event listener from an event. This could be for performance reasons (the event is no longer needed) or to avoid memory leaks (if an event listener references an object that is no longer needed, it won’t be able to be garbage-collected. This can lead to a build up of unnecessary objects).

## Object Oriented Programming + Event-Driven Programming
The last thing I want to touch on here is the combination of the Object Oriented and Event-driven programming paradigms. These two make for a very valuable combination in a wide variety of situations and I think it can be beneficial to understand and conceptualize why.
