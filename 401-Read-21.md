## JSX:
It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript.

## Why JSX?
React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
Most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

# JSX Fetures :
* You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.
* JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
* Use quotes to specify string literals as attributes.
* Use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute.
* JSX tags may contain children.
* By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application.

## Rendering Elements:
We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.

Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.

To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render().

## React Only Updates What’s Necessary
React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.

## Sass :
Sass is a stylesheet language that’s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, functions, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.
