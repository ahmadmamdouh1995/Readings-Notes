## Flexible Layouts#flexible-layouts:
Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units. These relative lengths are then used to declare common grid property values such as width, margin, or padding.

## Flexible Grid
Let’s see how this formula works inside of a two column layout. Below we have a parent division with the class of container wrapping both the section and aside elements. The goal is to have have the section on the left and the aside on the right, with equal margins between the two. Normally the markup and styles for this layout would look a bit like the following.

## Initializing Media Queries
There are a couple different ways to use media queries, using the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet, importing a new style sheet using the @import rule, or by linking to a separate style sheet from within the HTML document. Generally speaking it is recommend to use the @media rule inside of an existing style sheet to avoid any additional HTTP requests.

## Logical Operators in Media Queries
Logical operators in media queries help build powerful expressions. There are three different logical operators available for use within media queries, including and, not, and only.

Using the and logical operator within a media query allows an extra condition to be added, making sure that a browser or devices does both a, b, c, and so forth. Multiple individual media queries can be comma separated, acting as an unspoken or operator. The example below selects all media types between 800 and 1024 pixels wide.

## Media Features in Media Queries
Knowing the media query syntax and how logical operators work is a great introduction to media queries but the true work comes with media features. Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression.

## Orientation Media Feature
The orientation media feature determines if a device is in the landscape or portrait orientation. The landscape mode is triggered when the display is wider than taller, and the portrait mode is triggered when the display is taller than wider. This media feature plays a large part with mobile devices.

## Aspect Ratio Media Features
The aspect-ratio and device-aspect-ratio features specifies the width/height pixel ratio of the targeted rendering area or output device. The min and max prefixes are available to use with the different aspect ratio features, identifying a ratio above or below that of which is stated.

The value for the aspect ratio feature consist of two positive integers separated by a forward slash. The first integer identifies the width in pixels while the second integer identifies the height in pixels.

## Resolution Media Feature
The resolution media feature specifies the resolution of the output device in pixel density, also known as dots per inch or DPI. The resolution media feature does accept the min and max prefixes. Additionally, the resolution media feature will accept dots per pixel (1.3dppx), dots per centimeter (118dpcm), and other length based resolution values.

## Viewport Height & Width
Using the viewport meta tag with either the height or width values will define the height or width of the viewport respectively. Each value accepts either a positive integer or keyword. For the height property the keyword device-height value is accepted, and for the width property the keyword device-width is accepted. Using these keywords will inherit the device’s default height and width value.

For the best results, and the best looking website, it is recommend that you use the device defaults by applying the device-height and device-width values.

Viewport Scale
To control how a website is scaled on a mobile device, and how users can continue to scale a website, use the minimum-scale, maximum-scale, initial-scale, and user-scalable properties.

The initial-scale of a website should be set to 1 as this defines the ratio between the device height, while in a portrait orientation, and the viewport size. Should a device be in landscape mode this would be the ratio between the device width and the viewport size. Values for initial-scale should always be a positive integer between 0 and 10.

## Flexible Media#flexible-media
The final, equally important aspect to responsive web design involves flexible media. As viewports begin to change size media doesn’t always follow suit. Images, videos, and other media types need to be scalable, changing their size as the size of the viewport changes.

One quick way to make media scalable is by using the max-width property with a value of 100%. Doing so ensures that as the viewport gets smaller any media will scale down according to its containers width.

## What is "Float"?
Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called "text wrap". Here is an example of that.

### There are four valid values for the float property. Left and Right float elements those directions respectively. None (the default) ensures the element will not float and Inherit which will assume the float value from that elements parent element.

## What are floats used for?
Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

## Clearing the Float
Float's sister property is clear. An element that has the clear property set on it will not move up adjacent to the float like the float desires, but will move itself down past the float. Again an illustration probably does more good than words do.

## Clearing Float
 Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Inherit would be the fifth, but is strangely not supported in Internet Explorer. Clearing only the left or right float, while less commonly seen in the wild, definitely has its uses.

## The Great Collapse
One of the more bewildering things about working with floats is how they can affect the element that contains them (their "parent" element). If this parent element contained nothing but floated elements, the height of it would literally collapse to nothing. This isn't always obvious if the parent doesn't contain any visually noticeable background, but it is important to be aware of.

### Techniques for Clearing Floats :
* The Empty Div Method is, quite literally, an empty div. "div style="clear: both;"""/div". Sometimes you'll see a "br" element or some other random element used, but div is the most common because it has no browser default styling, doesn't have any special function, and is unlikely to be generically styled with CSS. This method is scorned by semantic purists since its presence has no contextual meaning at all to the page and is there purely for presentation. Of course in the strictest sense they are right, but it gets the job done right and doesn't hurt anybody.
* The Overflow Method relies on setting the overflow CSS property on a parent element. If this property is set to auto or hidden on the parent element, the parent will expand to contain the floats, effectively clearing it for succeeding elements. This method can be beautifully semantic as it may not require additional elements. However if you find yourself adding a new div just to apply this, it is equally as non-semantic as the empty div method and less adaptable. Also bear in mind that the overflow property isn't specifically for clearing floats. Be careful not to hide content or trigger unwanted scrollbars.
* The Easy Clearing Method uses a clever CSS pseudo selector (:after) to clear floats. Rather than setting the overflow on the parent, you apply an additional class like "clearfix" to it.

## Problems with Floats
Floats often get beat on for being fragile. The majority of this fragility comes from IE 6 and the slew of float-related bugs it has. As more and more designers are dropping support for IE 6, you may not care, but for the folks that do care here is a quick rundown.

* Pushdown is a symptom of an element inside a floated item being wider than the float itself (typically an image). Most browsers will render the image outside the float, but not have the part sticking out affect other layout. IE will expand the float to contain the image, often drastically affecting layout.
* Double Margin Bug - Another thing to remember when dealing with IE 6 is that if you apply a margin in the same direction as the float, it will double the margin. Quick fix: set display: inline on the float, and don't worry it will remain a block-level element.
* The 3px Jog is when text that is up next to a floated element is mysteriously kicked away by 3px like a weird forcefield around the float. Quick fix: set a width or height on the affected text.
* In IE 7, the Bottom Margin Bug is when if a floated parent has floated children inside it, bottom margin on those children is ignored by the parent. Quick fix: using bottom padding on the parent instead.

## Alternatives
If you need text wrapping around images, there really aren't any alternatives for float. Speaking of which, check out this rather clever technique for wrapping text around irregular shapes. But for page layout, there definitely are choices. Eric Sol right here on A List Apart has an article on Faux Absolute Positioning, which is a very interesting technique that in many ways combines the flexibility of floats with the strength of absolute positioning. CSS3 has the Template Layout Module that, when widely adopted, will prove to be the page layout technique of choice.
