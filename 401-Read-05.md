## Repository pattern separates the data access logic and maps it to the business entities in the business logic. Communication between the data access logic and the business logic  is done through interfaces.
Reposiory Design Pattern

To put it simply, Repository pattern is a kind of container where data access logic is stored. It hides the details of data access logic from business logic. In other words, we allow business logic to access the data object without having knowledge of underlying data access architecture.

The separation of data access from business logic have many benefits. Some of them are:

1. Centralization of the data access logic makes code easier to maintain
2. Business and data access logic can be tested separately
3. Reduces duplication of code
4. A lower chance for making programming errors
5. Repository design pattern is  fully stick onto interfaces. An interface acts 6. like a contract which specify what an concrete class must implement.
 Let’s explore it a little bit. Suppose we have two data objects Uploader and Video, what are common set of operations that can be applied to these two data objects? In most situations we want to have the following operations:

Get all records
Get paginated set of records
Create a new record
Get record by it’s primary key
Get record by some other attribute
Update a record
Delete a record
If we implement these operations for each object, you can imagine that the number of duplicate code in the entire application. For small application it doesn’t matter, but for larger applications it is a bad news.

As we know what is a repository, we can use it for flexible controller methods implementation.

Illustration of problem that we are not using Repositories
It is better to know the problem with an example. For example, suppose we have the following index method in the UserController.php file.

## Flexibility through Repositories

In order to separate our Controllers from the database in right manner, we are going to abstract that interaction into repositories. A repository is simply an interface between two things.

So instead of referencing Eloquent directly, we can reference UserRepository. We can then bind UserRepository to EloquentUserRepository so that Laravel knows that whenever we mention UserRepository we want an instance of EloquentUserRepository. Now that we have abstracted the database layer into repositories it makes it much easier to switch database ORM.

For example, if you wanted to use Mongo instead, you would simply create a MongoUserRepository and bind UserRepository to it rather than EloquentUserRepository.

Now, whenever Laravel wants a UserRepository it will return MongoUserRepository.
So you don’t have to change any of the code in your Controllers on a database technology change.

What do we need to build?

In order for our application to use Repositories, first we need to set things up.
We are going to need:

UserRepository
EloquentUserRepository
A way to bind UserRepository and EloquentUserRepository
We can use Service Providers to bind things together. Service Providers are just like bootstrap classes that allow you to set things up in a certain way.

Project structure

It’s pretty bad practice to just dump stuff in a random file or leave things in the wrong directory. As your project gets bigger, things will become a mess and everything will be unmaintainable.
Instead, we are going to create a new directory called app/lib to store all of this kind of stuff.
In order for this directory to be included in the autoload, you also need to add it to your composer.json file.
