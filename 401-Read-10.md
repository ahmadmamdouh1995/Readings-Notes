## router.param(name, callback)

### The parameters of the callback function are:
* req, the request object.
* res, the response object.
* next, indicating the next middleware function.
* The value of the name parameter.
* The name of the parameter.

Param callback functions are local to the router on which they are defined. They are not inherited by mounted apps or routers.

The behavior of the router.param(name, callback) method can be altered entirely by passing only a function to router.param(). This function is a custom implementation of how router.param(name, callback) should behave - it accepts two parameters and must return a middleware.

The first parameter of this function is the name of the URL parameter that should be captured, the second parameter can be any JavaScript object which might be used for returning the middleware implementation.

The middleware returned by the function decides the behavior of what happens when a URL parameter is captured.

## router.route(path)

Returns an instance of a single route which you can then use to handle HTTP verbs with optional middleware.

## Mongoose has 4 types of middleware:
* document middleware,
* model middleware,
* aggregate middleware, 
* query middleware.


## Subdocuments :
Subdocuments are documents embedded in other documents. In Mongoose, this means you can nest schemas in other schemas.

## Populate Virtuals:
 The Count Option Populate virtuals support counting the number of documents with matching foreignField as opposed to the documents themselves.
