# Redux
### Definition
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. (It helps you write applications that behave consistently)


## Redux principle:
* Have a single source of truth: The state of your whole application is stored in an object tree within a single Redux store.
* The only way to change the state is to emit an action, an object describing what happened.
* To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.

## Benifits
* In larger apps with a lot of moving pieces, state management becomes a huge concern. Redux ticks that off quite well without performance concerns or trading off testability.
* A lot of developers love Redux for the developer experience that comes with it.
* Using Redux you will get good features; include logging, hot reloading, time travel, universal apps, record and replay â€” all without doing so much on your end as the developer.
