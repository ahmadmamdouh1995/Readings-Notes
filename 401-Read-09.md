## Routing
 
 refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. For an introduction to routing.

## Routing In details:
 These routing methods specify a callback function (sometimes called “handler functions”) called when the application receives a request to the specified route (endpoint) and HTTP method. In other words, the application “listens” for requests that match the specified route(s) and method(s), and when it detects a match, it calls the specified callback function.

 ## Route paths
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

# Route parameters:
* Route path: /users/:userId/books/:bookId
* Request URL: http://localhost:3000/users/34/books/8989
* req.params: { "userId": "34", "bookId": "8989" 


## Route handlers

Route handlers can be in the form of a function, an array of functions, or combinations of both.
