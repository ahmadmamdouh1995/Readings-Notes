## WebSocket :
is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

## Key features of WebSocket 

* WebSocket helps in real-time communication between the Client and the web server.
* This protocol helps in transforming to cross-platform in a real time world between the server and the client.
* This also enables the business around the world for real-time web application to enhance and to increase the feasibility.
* The major advantage it stands over an HTTP connection that it provides full duplex communication.

## Why do we need WebSocket?

* It provides the full duplex communication which helps in persisting the connection established between the Client and the Web Server.
* It also lives up to the standards and provides the accuracy and efficiency stream events to and from with negligible latency.
* WebSocket removes the overhead and reduce complexity.
* It makes real-time communication effortless and efficient.

## Key Differences between WebSocket and socket.io
Both WebSocket vs Socket.io are popular choices in the market; let us discuss some of the major Difference Between WebSocket vs Socket.io:

* It provides the Connection over TCP while Socket.io is a library to abstract the WebSocket connections.
* WebSocket doesnâ€™t have fallback options while Socket.io supports fallback.
* WebSocket is technology while Socket.io is a library for WebSockets.

## Conclusion
This is all about the WebSocket vs Socket.io. There is not much theoretically to learn about these topics. You have to be practical for that. Basically, WebSocket is a browser inherited technology the more you code the more you will learn.

## What Socket.IO is
Socket.IO is a library that enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication between the browser and the server
