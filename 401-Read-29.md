## RBAC
RBAC stands for Role Based Access Control and it is process by which we give permission to the user based on their access rights whether he a student , emloyee , admin or what ever he .

## Benefits of RBAC 

* Reducing administrative work and IT support.
 In this part you can reducing the need to change roles and passwords when hiring or changing an employee, roles can also be quickly added and switched and implemented broadly across operating systems, platforms, and applications. It also reduces the possibility of error when setting user permissions. Third-party users can also be more easily integrated into your network by giving them pre-defined roles.
* Maximizing operational efficiency.
 In this section, you can easily and smoothly control. Instead of facing problems in getting to the lowest level of control, all roles can be controlled with the business organizational structure and users can do their jobs more efficiently and independently.
* Improving compliance.
 Businesses can meet legal and regulatory requirements for privacy and confidentiality more easily as IT departments and executives have the power to manage how data is accessed and used.

 ## How we can implement the RBAC
 1. Create a list of every software, hardware and app that has some sort of security.
 2. Create a formal list and list of roles and specify what each member of the team does
 3. Writing any changes that are made and informing all members of them through this technology.
 4. This is a good time to make changes after you understand the current security situation and roles
 5. You should frequently assess your roles and security situation. First, evaluate how successful the creation / production process is and second, how safe the process you are doing is.
