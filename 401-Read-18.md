## The OSI model
The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

## The OSI model Layers :
* 7. The Application Layer : This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user.
* 6. This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user.
* 5. The Session Layer : This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. 
* 4. The Transport Layer : Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices.
* 3. The Network Layer : The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks.
* 2. The Data Link Layer : The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the SAME network.
* 1. The Physical Layer : This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches.

## Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) :
a connection-oriented communications protocol that facilitates the exchange of messages between computing devices in a network. It is the most common protocol in networks that use the Internet Protocol (IP); together they are sometimes referred to as TCP/IP.

## The three-way handshake
### Prerequisites for establishing a valid TCP connection:
 * Both endpoints must already have a unique IP address (IPv4 or IPv6)
 * have assigned and enabled the desiredport for data transfer.
 *  The IP address serves as an identifier, whereas the port allows the operating system to assign connections to the specific client and server applications.
