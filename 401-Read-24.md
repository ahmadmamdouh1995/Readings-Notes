## A Simple React Router v4:
React Router v4 is a pure React rewrite of the popular React package. Previous versions of React Router used configuration disguised as pseudo-components and could be difficult to understand. With v4, everything is “just components”.

### History
Each router creates a history object, which it uses to keep track of the current location 1 and re-render the website whenever that changes.

### The <App>
Our application is defined within the "App" component.

### Routes
The "Route" component is the main building block of React Router. Anywhere that you want to only render content based on the location’s pathname, you should use a "Route" element.

### Path
A "Route" expects a path prop, which is a string that describes the pathname that the route matches 

## Hooks
React Router ships with a few hooks that let you access the state of the router and perform navigation from inside your components.
* useHistory : The useHistory hook gives you access to the history instance that you may use to navigate.
* useLocation : The useLocation hook returns the location object that represents the current URL. You can think about it like a useState that returns a new location whenever the URL changes.
* useParams : useParams returns an object of key/value pairs of URL parameters. Use it to access match.params of the current "Route".
* useRouteMatch : The useRouteMatch hook attempts to match the current URL in the same way that a "Route" would. It’s mostly useful for getting access to the match data without actually rendering a "Route".

## <BrowserRouter>
A "Router" that uses the HTML5 history API (pushState, replaceState and the popstate event) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

## <HashRouter>
A "Router" that uses the hash portion of the URL (i.e. window.location.hash) to keep your UI in sync with the URL.

## <Redirect>
Rendering a "Redirect" will navigate to a new location. The new location will override the current location in the history stack, like server-side redirects (HTTP 3xx) do.

## <Route>
The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL.

## Queries
* getBy : getBy* queries return the first matching node for a query, and throw an error if no elements match or if more than one match is found (use getAllBy instead).
* getAllBy : getAllBy* queries return an array of all matching nodes for a query, and throw an error if no elements match.
* queryBy : queryBy* queries return the first matching node for a query, and return null if no elements match. This is useful for asserting an element that is not present. This throws if more than one match is found (use queryAllBy instead).
* queryAllBy : queryAllBy* queries return an array of all matching nodes for a query, and return an empty array ([]) if no elements match.
* findBy : findBy* queries return a promise which resolves when an element is found which matches the given query. The promise is rejected if no element is found or if more than one element is found after a default timeout of 1000ms. If you need to find more than one element, then use findAllBy.
* findAllBy : findAllBy* queries return a promise which resolves to an array of elements when any elements are found which match the given query. The promise is rejected if no elements are found after a default timeout of 1000ms.
