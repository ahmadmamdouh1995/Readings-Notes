## Security of Password:
Passwords are the first line of defense against cyber criminals. It is the most vital secret of every activity we do over the internet and also a final check to get into any of your user account, whether it is your bank account, email account, shopping cart account or any other account you have.

## PROBLEMS WITH CRYPTOGRAPHIC HASH ALGORITHM
* Brute Force attack.
* Hash Collision attack.

### BCrypt:
* Bcrypt is an adaptive hash function based on the Blowfish symmetric block cipher cryptographic algorithm and introduces a work factor (also known as security factor), which allows you to determine how expensive the hash function will be.

## Basic Access Authentication :
is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request.
In basic HTTP authentication, a request contains a header field in the form of Authorization: "Basic '<'credentials'>'".

## Protocol:
* Server side : When the server wants the user agent to authenticate itself towards the server, the server must respond appropriately to unauthenticated requests.
* Client side : When the user agent wants to send authentication credentials to the server, it may use the Authorization field.

## JSON Web Token :
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.

## JSON Web Tokens Uses :
* Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token.
* Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties.


## JSON Web Token Structure :
* Header
* Payload
* Signature

## Authentication :
Authentication is the process of verifying that an individual, entity or website is whom it claims to be.
