## OAuth :

 OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.

 ## Uses of OAuth :

OAuth can be used as an authorizing mechanism to consume secured RSS/ATOM feeds. Consumption of RSS/ATOM feeds that require authentication has always been an issue. 

## OpenID VS pseudo-authentication using OAuth:
* (Not pictured) The user requests a resource or site login from the application.
* The site sees that the user is not authenticated. 
* The user's browser requests the redirect URL for the identity provider, including the application's request
* If necessary, the identity provider authenticates the user (perhaps by asking them for their username and password)
* Once the identity provider is satisfied that the user is sufficiently authenticated.
* The user's browser requests the redirect URL that goes back to the application, including the identity provider's response
* The application decodes the identity provider's response, and carries on accordingly.
* (OAuth only) The response includes an access token which the application can use to gain direct access to the identity provider's services on the user's behalf.

## Roles of OAuth :

### The Third-Party Application: "Client"
The client is the application that is attempting to get access to the user's account. 

### The API: "Resource Server"
The resource server is the API server used to access the user's information.

### The Authorization Server
This is the server that presents the interface where the user approves or denies the request. In smaller implementations .

### The User: "Resource Owner"
The resource owner is the person who is giving access to some portion of their account.
