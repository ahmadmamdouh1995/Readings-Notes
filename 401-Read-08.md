## Middleware functions:
  are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

## Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

* Execute any code.
* Make changes to the request and the response objects.
* End the request-response cycle.
* Call the next middleware function in the stack.

## Built-in middleware:
* express.static serves static assets such as HTML files, images, and so on.
* express.json parses incoming requests with JSON payloads. 
* express.urlencoded parses incoming requests with URL-encoded payloads.

## Routing :
refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests.

## Route methods
A route method is derived from one of the HTTP methods, and is attached to an instance of the express class.

## Route paths
Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made. Route paths can be strings, string patterns, or regular expressions.

## Route parameters
Route parameters are named URL segments that are used to capture the values specified at their position in the URL.

## Route handlers
You can provide multiple callback functions that behave like middleware to handle a request. The only exception is that these callbacks might invoke next('route') to bypass the remaining route callbacks.
