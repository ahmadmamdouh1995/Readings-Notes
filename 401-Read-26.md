# Hooks
### React hooks allow to to easily create and manage state in a functional component.

* Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose additional rules:
  * Hooks must be named with a use prefix (i.e. useFishingPole)
  * Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
  * Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions.

### Hooks solve these problems:
* Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
* Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
* Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

### Basic Hooks :
* useState
* useEffect
* useContext

### Additional Hooks
* useReducer
* useCallback
* useMemo
* useRef
* useImperativeHandle
* useLayoutEffect
* useDebugValue
