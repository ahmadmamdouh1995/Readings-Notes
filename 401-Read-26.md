## Hook :
 is a special function that lets us “hook into” React features.
 For example, useState is a Hook that lets us add React state to function components.

## Hook Using:
 If we write a function component and realize we need to add some state to it, previously we had to convert it to a class.
 So we can use a Hook inside the existing function component.  

* we use useState directly in Hooks nested useing this.setStat in class constructor 

* React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState, also we can create our own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components.

## The Effect Hook:
 "useEffect" adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as "componentDidMount", "componentDidUpdate", and "componentWillUnmount" in React classes, but unified into a single API.

## Rules of Hooks :
Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:
* Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.
* Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. 


### Hooks solv these problems:
* Huge components that are hard to refactor and test.
* Duplicated logic between different components and lifecycle methods.
* Complex patterns like render props and higher-order components.

### Basic Hooks :
* useState
* useEffect
* useContext

### Additional Hooks
* useReducer
* useCallback
* useMemo
* useRef
* useImperativeHandle
* useLayoutEffect
* useDebugValue
