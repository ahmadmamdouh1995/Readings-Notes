## Trees

### Common Terminology
* Node - A node is the individual item/data that makes up the data structure
* Root - The root is the first/top Node in the tree
* Left Child - The node that is positioned to the left of a root or node
* Right Child - The node that is positioned to the right of a root or node
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not contain any children
* Height - The height of a tree is determined by the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node.

### Traversals

* Depth First
Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root.

* * Pre-order: root >> left >> right
* * In-order: left >> root >> right
* * Post-order: left >> right >> root

* Breadth First
Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

### Adding a node
Because there are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree, it really doesn’t matter where a new node gets placed.

### Big O
The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n).

### Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it.
