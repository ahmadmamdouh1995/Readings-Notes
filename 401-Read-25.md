# Hash tables
Hashing is a technique that is used to uniquely identify a specific object from a group of similar objects. 

In hashing, large keys are converted into small keys by using hash functions. The values are then stored in a data structure called hash table. The idea of hashing is to distribute entries (key/value pairs) uniformly across an array. Each element is assigned a key (converted key). By using that key you can access the element in O(1) time. Using the key, the algorithm (hash function) computes an index that suggests where an entry can be found or inserted.

## Hashing
Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. Itâ€™s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input.

## implemented Hashing

* An element is converted into an integer by using a hash function. This element can be used as an index to store the original element, which falls into the hash table.
* The element is stored in the hash table where it can be quickly retrieved using hashed key.

## Hash function
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

## Double hashing
Double hashing is similar to linear probing and the only difference is the interval between successive probes. Here, the interval between probes is computed by using two hash functions.
