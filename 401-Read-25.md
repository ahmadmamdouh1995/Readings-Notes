# Hash tables
Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner.
In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value.
Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

## Hashing
Hashing is a technique to convert a range of key values into a range of indexes of an array.

## Collision in HashTable
Since a hash function gets us a small number for a key which is a big integer or string, there is a possibility that two keys result in the same value.
The situation where a newly inserted key maps to an already occupied slot in the hash table is called collision and must be handled using some collision handling technique.

## Ways of handling collisions:
1. Linear probing : If a pair is hashed to a slot which is already occupied, it searches linearly for the next free slot in the table.
2. Chaining : The hash table will be an array of linked lists. All keys mapping to the same index will be stored as linked list nodes at that index.
3. Resizing the hash table :The size of the hash table can be increased in order to spread the hash entries further apart.

## Hash function
A hash function is any function that can be used to map a data set of an arbitrary size to a data set of a fixed size, which falls into the hash table. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash sums, or simply hashes.

## Double hashing
Double hashing uses the idea of applying a second hash function to key when a collision occurs.
