## 5 Concepts in React:
1. The Component Lifecycle: lifecycle. The component lifecycle is exactly what it sounds like: it details the life of a component.
2. Higher-Order Components: A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.
3. React State and setState():It’s important to understand that when there’s a state change, React will trigger a re-render on that component (unless you specify in shouldComponentUpdate to say otherwise).
4. React Context :The React context API allows you to create global context objects that can be given to any component you make. 
5. Stay up to date with React : It’s simply keeping up with the latest releases of React. 

## What even is ‘children’? 
The simple explanation of what this.props.children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.

## About Inheritance
Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions.

## Delaying evaluation of children / condition
It is important to note that, because JavaScript is an eagearly evaluated language, children of both the Then and Else component and condition will be evaluated regardless of the value of the condition. Should that be an issue for performance reasons, one can wrap said children / condition in a arrow function, to delay evaluation of the children / condition.


## Async Utilities
These can be useful to wait for an element to appear or disappear in response to an action, All the async utils are built on top of waitFor.
