## Socket
Sockets have traditionally been the solution around which most real-time chat systems are architected, providing a bi-directional communication channel between a client and a server.

This means that the server can push messages to clients. Whenever you write a chat message, the idea is that the server will get it and push it to all other connected clients.

## The web framework
The first goal is to set up a simple HTML webpage that serves out a form and a list of messages. Weâ€™re going to use the Node.JS web framework express to this end. Make sure Node.JS is installed.


## Socket.IO is composed of two parts:

* A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
* A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client


## Emitting events
The main idea behind Socket.IO is that you can send and receive any events you want, with any data you want. Any objects that can be encoded as JSON will do, and binary data is supported too.


## Default room
Each Socket in Socket.IO is identified by a random, unguessable, unique identifier Socket#id. For your convenience, each socket automatically joins a room identified by its own id.


## Disconnection
Upon disconnection, sockets leave all the channels they were part of automatically, and no special teardown is needed on your part.


## Sending messages from the outside-world
There are several ways to tackle this problem, like implementing your own channel to send messages into the process.
To facilitate this use case, we created two modules:

* socket.io-redis
* socket.io-emitter
