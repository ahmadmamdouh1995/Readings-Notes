## Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class

## Forms
HTML form elements work a little bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state.
### Controlled Components
In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState().

### The textarea Tag
* In HTML, a <textarea> element defines its text by its children.
* In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a <textarea> can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input.

### The select Tag
* In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list.
* React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag.


### Converting a Function to a Class
You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:

* Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.
* Add a single empty method to it called render().
* Move the body of the function into the render() method.
* Replace props with this.props in the render() body.
* Delete the remaining empty function declaration.

### The Data Flows Down
Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.

### Why React Testing Library
Basically, React Testing Library (RTL) is made of simple and complete React DOM testing utilities that encourage good testing practices
