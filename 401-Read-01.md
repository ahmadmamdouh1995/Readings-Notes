## What is Node.js?
Node.js is an open source server environment
Node.js is free
Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
Node.js uses JavaScript on the server
Why Node.js?
Node.js uses asynchronous programming!

A common task for a web server can be to open a file on the server and return the content to the client.

## Here is how PHP or ASP handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Waits while the file system opens and reads the file.
Returns the content to the client.
Ready to handle the next request.
Here is how Node.js handles a file request:

Sends the task to the computer's file system.
Ready to handle the next request.
When the file system has opened and read the file, the server returns the content to the client.
Node.js eliminates the waiting, and simply continues with the next request.

## Node.js runs single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronously programming, which is very memory efficient.

What Can Node.js Do?
Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
Node.js files have extension ".js"

## Node.js came into existence when the original developers of JavaScript extended it from something you could only run in the browser to something you could run on your machine as a standalone application.

Now you can do much more with JavaScript than just making websites interactive.

JavaScript now has the capability to do things that other scripting languages like Python can do.

Both your browser JavaScript and Node.js run on the V8 JavaScript runtime engine. This engine takes your JavaScript code and converts it into a faster machine code. Machine code is low-level code which the computer can run without needing to first interpret it.

## About npm
npm is the worldâ€™s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

pm consists of three distinct components:

the website
the Command Line Interface (CLI)
the registry
Use the website to discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of your npm experience. For example, you can set up Orgs (organizations) to manage access to public or private packages.

The CLI runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.

The registry is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

## Use npm to . . .
Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
Download standalone tools you can use right away.
Run packages without downloading using npx.
Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
Restrict code to specific developers.
Create Orgs (organizations) to coordinate package maintenance, coding, and developers.
Form virtual teams by using Orgs.
Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.
Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.
Discover multiple ways to solve the same puzzle.
Find other developers who are working on similar problems and projects.
Getting started
To get started with npm, you can create an account, which will be available at http://www.npmjs.com/~yourusername.

After you set up an npm account, the next step is to use the command line interface (CLI) to install npm. We look forward to seeing what you create!

Sharing packages and collaborating with others
If you choose to share your packages publicly, there is no cost. To use and share private packages, you need to upgrade your account. To share with others, create organizations, called npm Orgs, and invite others to work with you, privately (for a fee) or publicly (for free). Or you can sign up for a private instance of npm for your company, called npm Enterprise, so you can develop packages internally that are not shared publicly.

For mentoring, tutorials, and learning, visit node school. Consider attending or hosting a nodeschool event (usually free!) at a site near you, or use the self-help tools you can find on the site.

CLI reference documentation
While relevant CLI commands are covered throughout this user documentation, the CLI includes command line help, its own documentation section, and instant help (man pages).

The current stable version of npm is here. To upgrade, run: npm install npm@latest -g
