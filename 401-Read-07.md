## What is REST
REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems and was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation.


## Guiding Principles of REST
1. Client–server 
2. Stateless
3. Cacheable
4. Uniform interface
5. Layered system
6. Code on demand 


## The diffrence between REST and HTTP 
A lot of people prefer to compare HTTP with REST. REST and HTTP are not same.

REST != HTTP

In simplest words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations. The clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol – typically HTTP.

## HTTP Basics
HTTP allows for communication between a variety of hosts and clients, and supports a mixture of network configurations.

## These request verbs are:

* GET: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
* POST: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
* PUT: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
* DELETE: delete an existing resource.

## There are some lesser used verbs that HTTP also supports:

* HEAD: this is similar to GET, but without the message body. It's used to retrieve the server headers for a particular resource, generally to check if the resource has changed, via timestamps.
* TRACE: used to retrieve the hops that a request takes to round trip from the server. Each intermediate proxy or gateway would inject its IP or DNS name into the Via header field. This can be used for diagnostic purposes.
* OPTIONS: used to retrieve the server capabilities. On the client-side, it can be used to modify the request based on what the server can support.

## 2xx: Successful

* 202 Accepted: the request was accepted but may not include the resource in the response. This is useful for async processing on the server side. The server may choose to send information for monitoring.
* 204 No Content: there is no message body in the response.
* 205 Reset Content: indicates to the client to reset its document view.
* 206 Partial Content: indicates that the response only contains partial content.

## 3xx: Redirection

* 301 Moved Permanently: the resource is now located at a new URL.
* 303 See Other: the resource is temporarily located at a new URL. The Location response header contains the temporary URL.
* 304 Not Modified: the server has determined that the resource has not changed and the client should use its cached copy.

## 4xx: Client Error

* 400 Bad Request: the request was malformed.
* 401 Unauthorized: request requires authentication. The client can repeat the request with the Authorization header. If the client already included the Authorization header, then the credentials were wrong.
* 403 Forbidden: server has denied access to the resource.
* 405 Method Not Allowed: invalid HTTP verb used in the request line, or the server does not support that verb.
* 409 Conflict: the server could not complete the request because the client is trying to modify a resource that is newer than the client's timestamp.

## 5xx: Server Error

* 501 Not Implemented: the server does not yet support the requested functionality.
* 503 Service Unavailable: this could happen if an internal system on the server has failed or the server is overloaded.
